# octarine
This project is intended to be for 3D what [fastplotlib](https://github.com/fastplotlib/fastplotlib) is for 2D: a high-performance, easy-to-use 3D viewer.
It is build on top off the excellent [pygfx](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx) rendering engine.

The name is inspired by _octarine_, the eighth color of the Discworld's magical spectrum, which is described as the color of magic itself.
